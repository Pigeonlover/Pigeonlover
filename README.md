## Hello, I'm Pigeonlover

This might shock you, but I love pigeons :dove: <br>

I've ben mesmerised by tech and computers since I played my first game, Pacman, at age 5. Nowadays I still play games (too many of them...), but I also code in my spare time. My languages of choice are HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Python. I am still pretty much a beginner, but my passion is certainly keeping me going forward!

On top of programming, I also love reading into the wee hours of the morning, drawing, playing with my cat, and dreaming about pigeons.
